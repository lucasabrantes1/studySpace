# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)

# Required modules: mod_alias, mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_core, mod_authn_file,
#                   mod_authz_core, mod_authz_user, mod_dav, mod_dav_fs,
#                   mod_setenvif

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

DavLockDB ${US_ROOTF}/tmp/DavLock

Alias /webdav "${US_ROOTF}/www/webdav/"

<Directory "${US_ROOTF}/www/webdav">
    Dav On
    AuthName "The Uniform Server"
    AuthUserFile ${US_ROOTF}/htpasswd/webdav/.htpasswd
    AuthType Basic
    AllowOverride None


    # Allow universal read-access, but writes are restricted
    # to the admin user.

# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a 
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle 
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
